            <h2>The Creation of the Earth:</h2>
                <p>In the beginning there was Te Korekore, the darkness where there was potential but as yet no life. Within Te Korekore lived Io the Supreme Being, Io who created numerous realms of Po, the night. Then the darkness gave way to Te Ata the dawn, from which the primal parents Papatūānuku, the Earth Mother and Ranginui; the Sky Father came into being. The firm embrace within which the parents held each other produced some seventy children all of whom became atua (gods). The children loved their parents but had to crawl between them and soon they yearned for space and light. The atua plotted to forcibly separate Papatūānuku and Ranginui with the task literally falling upon the shoulders of Tānemahuta, mighty god of the forests. At the moment Ranginui and Papatūānuku were parted the universe was created. All of the stars and planets came into being.</p>

                <p>In Te Ao Māori the entire earth is known as Papatūānuku the earth Mother. All of her mokopuna that dwell upon her (including all the birds and insects of the forest who are her grandchildren) depend on her for their wellbeing. People have the option of caring for her to maintain their own health or abandoning her. Ultimately an unhealthy Papatūānuku is going to lead to unhealthy people. By always keeping in mind the needs of Papatūānuku, our people were able to appreciate what would happen to the land (and them) if it was not kept in as natural a state as was possible. They only needed to look as far as their own bodies to understand how the earth would react if either were not looked after properly.</p>
            
                <p>Ranginui is our Skyfather, and it is from him that human life and knowledge were said to originate. In one tradition, the god Tāne climbed to the citadel Te Tihi-o-Manono, in the highest of the 12 heavens, known as Te Toi-o-ngā-rangi. There he retrieved three baskets of knowledge: te ketetuatea (basket of light), te kete-tuauri (basket of darkness) and te ketearonui (basket of pursuit). There are several interpretations of what each basket represents. The scholar Māori Marsden has suggested that the basket of light is present knowledge, the basket of darkness things unknown, and the basket of pursuit is the knowledge humans currently seek.</p>
